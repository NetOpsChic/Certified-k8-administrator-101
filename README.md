## Preparation Strategy  

### 1. Udemy Course by Mumshad Mannambeth [click here](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/?srsltid=AfmBOorw4BRW_khV_j44xo1OItHGBFy2x6DAPAVP5U-8oVl0fe1DkBka)

This course serves as a **solid foundation** for your preparation. It includes practice questions and mock exams that are crucial for building familiarity with Kubernetes commands.

- **Practice all the questions and mock exams repeatedly.**  
- Keep going until you develop **muscle memory** for the commands.  
- Aim to **memorize the solutions**, not just understand them. While the exam is practical, **your speed, memory, and typing accuracy** will be tested rigorously.  
- When you start feeling **bored or overconfident**, move to the next step.

### 2. Killer.sh Practice Tests [click here](https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cka)

Killer.sh provides **two full-length scenarios**, each available for **36 hours**. These are significantly **more difficult and time-consuming** than the actual exam.

- Expect to **fail your first attempt**—this is normal.  
- Utilize the full **72-hour** access period to practice and refine your approach.  
- **Schedule these tests on weekends** when you have uninterrupted time.  
- The **actual exam questions are very similar** to Killer.sh, so mastering this will prepare you well.

### 3. First Exam Attempt  
Your **first exam attempt should be treated as a practice run** rather than a pass-or-fail challenge.

- **You get two attempts**, so use the first one to familiarize yourself with the exam environment.  
- PSI, the exam proctoring platform, is **slow and can be frustrating**—be prepared for delays.  
- Focus on understanding the **question format, system navigation, and time management**.  
- If you pass, great. If not, **learn from your mistakes** and move forward.

### 4. Free Killer Koda Scenarios [click here](https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cka)

Killer Koda provides **free hands-on labs** with different Kubernetes scenarios. These are valuable for additional practice.

- **Solve every lab** to reinforce your skills.  
- If possible, **purchase Killer.sh again** ($29) for another round of practice.  
- **Revisit the Udemy course one last time** to solidify your knowledge.

## Final Thoughts  
By following this structured approach, you will develop:  

- **Speed and accuracy** in executing commands.  
- **Confidence in solving practical problems** under exam pressure.  
- **Patience and resilience** to handle unexpected challenges.
